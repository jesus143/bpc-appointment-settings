Hi Rich,

Update for Jan 6, 2017

allow ajax handle save and update of schedule data
add form to the calendar schedule this will handle the submition of data via ajax
remove sleep time interval for response display
in save and update data file include  main wordpress functionality
create class query for wordpress database main api
create class files for specific plugin database functionality
filter all sent request data from ajax, get specific data and filter specific data, values and etc...
check if open from then store data to a variable and if open to then start the update variable storage
allow insert data after filter, allow update data if already exist
add form field names to schedule files, 2 files
each form make name of the fields as array


I got road blocks in insert and update of schedule due to data complexity and i just fixed it.

Continue this tomorrow.
